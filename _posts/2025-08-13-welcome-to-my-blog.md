This is my first blog post on my new Jekyll-powered GitHub Pages website. For the first time in years, I decided not to use WordPress to build my website. My main motivation was to use a platform that will outlive my time and preserve my thoughts. I see GitHub playing the role of that eternal libraryâ€”not just for code, but also for progressive ideas.

## What to Expect

In this blog, I'll be covering a variety of topics including:

- Urban intelligence and smart city initiatives
- Gaming innovations and trends
- Space exploration and future technologies
- Personal reflections on technology and innovation

## Stay Connected

Feel free to reach out through the [Contact](/contact/) page if you have any questions or suggestions for topics you'd like me to cover.

I'm looking forward to sharing my ideas and engaging with readers!
