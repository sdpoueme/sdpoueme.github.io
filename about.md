## Hello! I'm Serge üëã

Welcome to Innovation Tales! I'm a software engineer with a passion for understanding how emerging technologies reshape our world. Through this blog, I explore the fascinating intersection of technology and society.

## What I Write About

My interests  span three key domains where technology is making the biggest impact:

### üèôÔ∏è Urban Intelligence
I love to dive deep into smart cities, urban planning, and how technology creates more livable, sustainable environments. From IoT sensor networks to digital twin city models, I explore how data and intelligent systems are transforming urban life.

### üéÆ Gaming Evolution  
Gaming isn't just entertainment‚Äîit's a testing ground for the future of human-computer interaction. I analyze how virtual worlds, interactive entertainment, and gaming technologies are pioneering new forms of digital experience.

### üöÄ Space Exploration
The new space age is here, driven by breakthrough technologies and commercial innovation. I cover the discoveries, missions, and technologies that are expanding humanity's presence beyond Earth.

## Why Innovation Tales?

In 2024, I started writing articles for my employer's newsletter. At that time, I was working in e-commerce and my focus was point-of-sales, payments, and merchandising technologies. I wrote an article about the "[Quiet Revolution in Mobile Commerce](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/20131001174457-10904058-the-start-of-a-quiet-revolution-in-mobile-commerce/)" (Rajat Taneja, ex Executive VP and CTO at Electronic Arts). 

This was the first article of a series exploring several topics such as machine-to-machine communications and location intelligence. While my [wordpress website](https://innovationtales.wordpress.com/2011/10/05/facebook-timeline-and-lifes-memories/) is no longer available, there have been many disruptions in the technology space and our societies. I believ the recent developments around Artificial Intelligence and Space Exploration are a unique opportunity to start a deep reflection on how humans will interact with technology in the future. 

Innovation Tales is the results of my perspectives on our current world and a projection in the future.
